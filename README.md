# Windows-Phone-7/8---Game-Projects

This was an old project made for the unive. I've realized two applications for Windows Phone 7/8.

NOTE: This code as the others old projects for the unive are very poorly commented, so unfortunately there isn't very much code commented here.

# Quiz Time

This is a very simple quiz game with multiple questions to answer, to win the game you just have to answer less than 20 questions. Questions are randomized, and are choosen from an XML file document
There isn't very much to say about this game,it was made in 2 week one for the graphics and the other for the coding.

# Zone

This is a rip off of another game called "Organ Trail" and only for the action part, so there's any management inside this game, I didn't have the time to implement it, also it is not worth it because this a very generic game not made only for academic purpose.
